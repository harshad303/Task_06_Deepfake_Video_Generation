## üìã Complete Workflow Overview

### **Phase 1: Content Planning (Based on Task 5)**
1. **Source Material Review:**
   - Analyzed Syracuse Women's Basketball 2023-24 statistics
   - Identified key coaching insights from Task 5 LLM analysis
   - Selected focus areas: defense improvement, Georgia Woolley development

2. **Script Development:**
   - Created 8-second interview dialogues
   - Integrated statistical insights into natural conversation
   - Developed two contrasting scenarios (professional vs. casual)

3. **Format Selection:**
   - Chose podcast-style interview for professional setting
   - Selected street interview for authentic campus atmosphere
   - Prioritized 8-second duration for focused content delivery

### **Phase 2: Prompt Engineering**
1. **Visual Requirements Definition:**
   - Researched Syracuse University official branding
   - Specified exact colors (#F76900 orange, #003594 blue)
   - Addressed common spelling errors ("SYRECUSE" ‚Üí "SYRACUSE")

2. **Character Development:**
   - Detailed appearance specifications (age, clothing, demeanor)
   - Defined interaction dynamics between interviewer and subject
   - Established authentic Syracuse community representation

3. **Technical Specifications:**
   - Set HD 1080p resolution requirements
   - Defined precise 8-second duration constraints
   - Specified audio sync timing for natural dialogue flow

### **Phase 3: Video Generation Process**
1. **Platform Selection:**
   - Google Gemini Veo 3
   - Evaluated free/student tier limitations
   - Tested prompt compatibility and output quality

2. **Generation Iterations:**
   - **First Attempt:** Basic prompt with generic university setting
   - **Second Attempt:** Added specific Syracuse branding requirements
   - **Final Generation:** Refined prompts with detailed specifications

3. **Quality Assessment:**
   - Evaluated visual realism and character authenticity
   - Verified audio synchronization accuracy
   - Confirmed Syracuse branding correctness
